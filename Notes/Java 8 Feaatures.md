# Language Features
    1. Default Methods
    2. Static Methods
    3. Optional Methods

    C       ~ FP
    C++     ~ OOP & FP
    Java    ~ before Java 7 OOP After Java 7 OOP & FP


# Functional Programming 
    Functions as Objects
    It implemented thru lambda expression and functional interface

    OOP ~ 
        We can't call without object
        We can't refer variable to functions.

    FP ~ 
        We can call fn directly 
        Fnality and data can be carried along

    JS ~ 
        It allows to pass and write one method inside another method 
        Variable can hold method



    1. Lambda Expression
        Function along with data
        

    Functional Interface
        Interface with only one abstract method, we can have static and default methods.

        Functional interfaces is the type for lambda expression

        Eg :

            In Java 7,

                Runnable
                Comparable

        @FunctionalInterface


# Design Patterns        

    1. Singleton DP

        Only one object for entire appln.
        We cant instantiate the class
        We must

        Eager Initialized Singleton
        Lazy Initialized Singleton
        Static Block Singleton

    2. Factory DP

# Stream API

    New feature in JAVA
    java.util.stream
      Stream ~ Sequence of bytes transferring from one place to another in file handling
    Stream API is new API in JAVA 8.
    It helps in sequential and parallel processing of data from Collections
    It allows to use mapfilter and reduce algorithm
