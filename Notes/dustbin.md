# MeanStack Developer

* We can do complete Enterprise application using JavaScript instead of java
                
    M : Mangodb replaces oracledb, MySQL
    E : Express replaces Spring Rest
    A : Angular replaces Spring MVC
    N : Nodejs replaces Tomacat

# Framework for frontend

1. Angular
    From Google
    Thymeleaf used to replace jsp in spring

2. React
    * It's a library
    * Used to design UI only which helps in rendering pages faster


# 

1. JSF (std)

    * For building rich UI Components
    
    JSF - > EJB - > db

    Angular - > Spring - > db

    * Primefaces (3rd party lib) -> which contains UI components for JSF    

    
2. JPA (Std)
    Java Persistent API

    * Instead of entity bean we can use JPA 
    * Hibernate implements the JPA
    * Default implementaion is EclipseLink, we are using hibernate.

3. Spring Boot    
    
    RApid application development
    Uses Spring framework
    Gives 


# Testing
    jasmine - for js
    Karma - to run jasmine


# Microservices

    Cloud 

    Opposite of Monolithic architecture.

1. Scenario : CRUD Operation runs on same JVm in Monolithic appln.
                In Microservice, Create operation runs on one JVM similarly every operation takes place 
                Each service register itself in registry (Ereka Server)

# Diff b/w library, architecture & DP
    
1. Library  
    * smallest unit among all
    * set of related fn.lity we can call
    Eg : (ojdbc.jar) ~ Library used for JDBC Connection

2. DP  
    * style of solving pblm

3. Framework 
    * Template for our own appln, and we can expand it
    * has many dp built in and tools which make job easier 
    * BUILT-IN SET OF LIBRARIES AND IMPLEMENTATIONS
    Eg : (Spring and struts based on Java Platform)

4. Architecture 
    * combination of many frameworks like 3 tier layer

5. Platform 
    * Supports framework
    * An infrastructure used to build an appln. (Java / .net)
    Eg : JRE, JVM
